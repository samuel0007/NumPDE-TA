\OptionalSection{The quick way: from a PDE to a LSE}{15}

\SubSectionWith{Introduction}{5min} 

Reminder: Midterm chapter 1 + chapter 2 but not 2.8: Monday, March 27th, at 16:15
Goals (from lecture script):
\begin{itemize}
    \item You must know in detail the idea of the Galerkin discretization of a linear variational problem and
how it leads to a linear system of equations.
\end{itemize}

 % TODO: Find nice 2D linear FEM example

 \SubSectionWith{Strong to Weak - the quick way}{10min}

 Note: this is not done like in the script, but I think presenting the students with this more "high level", not getting in the nitty gritty details is a good way to give them the synthetic understanding that the script is mostly missing.

We'll find the LSE for the equation $-u'' = f \quad in ]a,b[, \quad u(a)=u(b)=0$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given any space $V$, $u \in V$ can be rewritten as some expansion in a basis:
    $$ u(x) = \sum_i \mu_i \phi(x)$$
    \item Plug in the PDE:
    $$ - \sum_i \mu_i \phi_i(x)'' = f$$
    \item Projection on arbitrary $\phi_j$ to find its coefficient (projection in $L^2$ is like for our usual finite dimensional vectors, if you want to find the value of a component you use the scalar product, here it's similar but just with "infinite vectors <-> functions", thus an integral)
    $$ - \sum_i \mu_i \int_a^b \phi_i(x)''\phi_j(x) dx = \int_a^b f \phi_j(x) dx $$
    \item PI:
    $$ \sum_i \mu_i (\int_a^b \phi_i(x)'\phi_j(x)'dx - \phi_i'\phi_j |_a^b) = \int_b^a f\phi_j dx$$
    \item BC = 0 + Set $$\int_a^b \phi_i(x)'\phi_j(x)'dx =: A_{i,j}$$ $$\int_b^a f\phi_j dx =: b_j $$
    \item Rewrite as $$A_{:,j} \cdot \mu = b_j$$
    \item Define arbitrary finite basis ${\phi_1, ..., \phi_N}$, and as previous equation was for $\forall j$ then we arrive at a $NxN$ LSE:
    \item $$
    \begin{bmatrix}
    A_{:,1} \\
    \vdots \\
    A_{:, N}
    \end{bmatrix} \cdot \mu =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        b_1 \\
        \vdots \\
        b_N
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
\end{enumerate}

\OptionalSection{Galerkin Matrix}{10}

\OptionalSection{Assembly}{10}

\OptionalSection{Problem 0-2 MidTerm 21}{10}
Goal: Compute Galerkin Matrix by hand
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Formula for basis function $b^h_1$
    
    \item Give dimension of the basis function space
    \item Compute Element Matrix for cell $]0,h[$
    \item Compute Full Galerkin Matrix for M=3
\end{enumerate}


 \OptionalSection{Quiz}{10}
 This section is to gradually prepare the students for the midterm. Use the slides and give students a minute or two to solve the exercise and then look at the solution together.
