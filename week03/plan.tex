\OptionalSection{The quick way: from a PDE to a LSE}{15}

\SubSectionWith{Introduction}{5min} 

Reminder: Midterm chapter 1 + chapter 2 but not 2.8: Monday, March 27th, at 16:15
Goals (from lecture script):
\begin{itemize}
    \item You must know in detail the idea of the Galerkin discretization of a linear variational problem and how it leads to a linear system of equations.
\end{itemize}

 Show them the result (not the code) of the quick-fem.py script (can be found in the folder of this lesson plan). Goal of first part of this session is to be able to simulate by yourself using FEM.

 \SubSectionWith{Strong to Weak - the quick way}{10min}

 Note: this is not done like in the script, but I think presenting the students with this more "high level", not getting in the nitty gritty details is a good way to give them the synthetic understanding that the script is mostly missing.

We'll find the LSE for the equation $-u'' = f \quad in ]a,b[, \quad u(a)=u(b)=0$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given any space $V$, $u \in V$ can be rewritten as some expansion in a basis:
    $$ u(x) = \sum_i \mu_i \phi(x)$$
    \item Plug in the PDE:
    $$ - \sum_i \mu_i \phi_i(x)'' = f$$
    \item Projection on arbitrary $\phi_j$ to find its coefficient (projection in $L^2$ is like for our usual finite dimensional vectors, if you want to find the value of a component you use the scalar product, here it's similar but just with "infinite vectors <-> functions", thus an integral)
    $$ - \sum_i \mu_i \int_a^b \phi_i(x)''\phi_j(x) dx = \int_a^b f \phi_j(x) dx $$
    \item PI:
    $$ \sum_i \mu_i (\int_a^b \phi_i(x)'\phi_j(x)'dx - \phi_i'\phi_j |_a^b) = \int_b^a f\phi_j dx$$
    \item BC = 0 + Set $$\int_a^b \phi_i(x)'\phi_j(x)'dx =: A_{i,j}$$ $$\int_b^a f\phi_j dx =: b_j $$
    \item Rewrite as $$A_{:,j} \cdot \mu = b_j$$
    \item Define arbitrary finite basis ${\phi_1, ..., \phi_N}$, and as previous equation was for $\forall j$ then we arrive at a $NxN$ LSE:
    \item $$
    \begin{bmatrix}
    A_{:,1} \\
    \vdots \\
    A_{:, N}
    \end{bmatrix} \cdot \mu =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        b_1 \\
        \vdots \\
        b_N
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
\end{enumerate}

\OptionalSection{Toward computation of the Galerkin Matrix}{20}
\SubSectionWith{Galerkin Matrix}{2min.}
From above, identify the Galerkin matrix. 
Rewrite:
$$A := [a(\phi_i, \phi_j)]_{i,j  = 1}^N$$

Main goal of FEM: compute galerkin matrix in a smart and efficient way. 
Important Note: Sparsity, and i-j represent interaction (=common support) between $\phi_i$ and $\phi_j$

\SubSectionWith{Assembly}{8min.}
Always have in mind the end goal: compute every entry of the Galerkin Matrix where i-j is interaction between $\phi_i$ and $\phi_j$.

Note: tell the students to focus as they will have to solve an exercise just after about this.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Draw triangular mesh (two hexagons)
    \item Draw in 3d the linear tent basis functions for one of the hexagon, same for the other. Color 2d hexagons with basis functions.
    \item Write bilinear form
    $$a(\phi_i, \phi_j) = \int_{\Omega}\phi_i\phi_j dy $$
    \item Zoom on common support triangles and index interior with 1,2,3, vertices with i,j,k.
    $$ \int_{K_1} \phi_i | K_1 \phi_j | K_1 dx = \int_{K21} \phi_i | K_2 \phi_j | K_2 dx$$
    \item Introduce linear barycentric functions $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3$ as $ \phi_i | K_i$ (with correct indexing)
    \item Take cell perspective and look at all its contributions to the Galerkin Matrix, connecting to previous drawings
    $$ A(i,k) += \int \lambda_1 \lambda_2 dx $$, $$ A(i,i) += \int \lambda_1 \lambda_1 dx $$
    \item Define element matrix $$[a(\lambda_i,\lambda_j)]_{i,j=1}^3$$   
    
\end{enumerate}

\SubSectionWith{Problem 0-2 MidTerm 21}{10min.}

Advection equation on the board:
$$\pdv{u(x,t)}{t} = - \pdv{u(x,t)}{x}$$
Mesh + basis functions on the board, from 0 to 1, tent basis

Derive LSE:
$$u(x,t) = \sum_i \mu_i(t)\phi_i(x)$$
Plug-in
$$\sum_i \dot{\mu_i}(t)\phi_i(x) = - \sum_i \mu_i(t) \pdv{\phi}{x}(x)$$
Project
$$\sum_i \dot{\mu_i}(t) \int\phi_i(x)\phi_j(x)dx = - \sum_i \mu_i(t) \int\pdv{\phi_i}{x}(x)\phi_j(x)$$
Orthogonality + vector notation $\forall j$
$$\dot{\mu_j}(t) = - a (\phi_:, \phi_j) \cdot \mu(t)$$
Matrix Notation
$$\dot{\mu}(t) = - A\mu(t)$$


Goal: Compute Galerkin Matrix by hand for linear advection bilinear form:
$$a(\phi_i, \phi_j) = \int_0^1 \pdv{\phi_i}{x}(x)\phi_j(x)dx$$

Ask students to (let them some individual time to think about it. Then compare with neighbors.)
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Give Formula for basis function $b^h_1$
    \item Give dimension of the basis function space
    \item Compute Element Matrix for cell $]0,h[$
    \item Compute Full Galerkin Matrix for M=3
\end{enumerate}

At the end, you can quickly show the structure of the quick-fem.py script, and fill with the students the element matrix values.

\OptionalSection{Quiz}{10}
 This section is to gradually prepare the students for the midterm. Use the slides and give students a minute or two to solve the exercise and then look at the solution together.

    \item Find estimate of $$J(u_h) - J(u)$$ Say why this is interesting (we try to be as close as possible to original solution wrt to energy)
    \item Draw geometry intuition of orthogonality, and intuition why this is nice (we'll come back later on this with céa's later) (closest wrt. to energy)

(Lot of master students that didn't do CSE BSc in the class (so no NumCSE), so this is necessary)

- Sparse format, COO, CRS
- Sparse LinAlg

Then show and understand code  \url{https://github.com/erickschulz/NPDECODES/blob/master/lecturecodes/SimpleLinearFEM2D/matrix_assembler.cc}

\SubSectionWith{(If Time left) 2.2 Transformation of Galerkin Matrix}{10min.}

Main point: different basis, same solution ! Only difference is "how nice" (sparsity, condition) is the matrix.
